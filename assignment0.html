            I started playing video games with my father at a young age. We replayed Halo: Combat Evolved almost every time I was able to visit him. As I branched out to more games like Burnout and Tony Hawk, I knew this was going to be my main hobby. When I moved and lost all of my friends, games gave me an avenue to make new ones, who i still have to this day. My current career goal is game development, to match my hobby with a new-found love for programming.
